- 👋 Hi, I’m @bunny4502
- 👀 I’m interested in going into full-stack web development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Responsive Web Design
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn more from others!
- ⚡ Fun fact: As a young girl, I was part of an online community for other young girls that was ran by a group of women who empowered other young women to learn to code! (and play lots of fun online games and give each other advice)
